# DLBA_calib
 a novel targetless extrinsic calibration method for dual LiDARs, addressing non-overlapping fields of view and imprecise initial parameters. Our framework integrates sliding-window LiDAR bundle adjustment (LBA) with adaptive voxelization, eliminating reliance on artificial markers or manual tuning.
